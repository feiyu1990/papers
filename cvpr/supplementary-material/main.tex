\section{Dataset}
In the main paper, we calculated Kendall's $W$ of the image rating from 5 workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) in order to measure the consistency among people's rating. We further tested the statistical significance of Kendall's $W$. As shown in the main paper, there are different percentages of significant albums for each event type, ranging from 58\% to 98\%. Here, in addition to the percentage of significant albums, Table~\ref{event_type} shows the average Kendall's $W$ as well as Spearman's correlation $\rho$ for each event type. We can see that $Wedding$ albums receive on average the highest correlation/agreement, while $Personal Art Activity$ albums receive the lowest score.

Figure~\ref{album_figure2} shows an example of the ground truth we obtained from AMT. Scores are normalized so that the range is (0,1), 1 being most important and 0 being totally irrelevant. It's best viewed electronically. Note that all images are stretched and distorted for viewing.
%\textcolor{red}{Figure~\ref{album_figure} and \ref{album_figure2} are two versions I have, one with original aspect ratio of images, one with stretched version. I think Figure~\ref{album_figure2} one is more neat but some images are less attractive than they are in stretched version.}

As mentioned in the main paper, for each album, we used Spearman's rank correlation ($\rho$) and Kendall's $W$ to evaluate the consistency from AMT workers' rating. Here we show some examples of albums in Figure~\ref{figure2} with their average $\rho$ and $W$. Note that the average $\rho$ and $W$ are for an individual album.

Figure~\ref{wedding_album}-\ref{birthday_album} show two examples of albums that receive relatively high correlation and agreement from 5 AMT workers, and Figure~\ref{fig:sfig3}-\ref{fig:sfig4} show two examples of albums that receive low correlation and agreement from 5 AMT workers. Figure~\ref{fig:sfig4} shows an example in which all the images are of similar quality and semantics, and it's hard for people to agree on the ranking.

\section{Architecture of Face Heatmap CNN}
In the main paper, we mentioned that the face heatmap CNN uses the similar siamese CNN architecture to train simultaneously for 23 event types. Here in Figure~\ref{face_figure}, we show the exact architecture we used for Face Heatmap network.

\section{Result}
In this section, we present both quantitative results and qualitative results in addition to the main paper. 
\subsection{Quantitative Results}
%\textcolor{red}{Here I have two figures: Figure~\ref{figure5} and Figure~\ref{figure6_worker} for you to choose. ~\ref{figure5} doesn't include AMT worker's performance, while the other does.}
In Figure~\ref{bar_result_event_type}, we show the comparison of $\text{MAP}@t\%5$ by six methods for each of the 23 event types. The six methods being compared are: random ranking, aesthetics, K nearest neighbors with pre-trained CNN features (KNN), single network with Euclidean loss (Euclidean), siamese network with ranking SVM loss (Ranking-SVM), and our method using Ensemble of siamese CNNs (Ensemble). We also show a ``worker" method here for comparison. It is calculated as follows: for each album, we have 5 rankings from 5 workers, and we can calculate the MAP score for each worker's rating against the ground truth. Then all the MAPs over all albums are averaged for one event type. The ``worker" method is to measure how workers did on those albums.

As shown, our method outperforms all the other methods in most cases, except for \textit{Personal Art Activity}, \textit{Architecture},  \textit{Business Activity},  \textit{Protest} and  \textit{Nature Trip}. Our method can even beat ``worker" in some cases.

As mentioned in the main paper, the aesthetic score doesn't perform well overall, however, it has good performance on two event types: \textit{Personal Art Activity} and \textit{Nature Trip}. Especially for \textit{Nature Trip}, aesthetics achieves the best performance over all methods.

\caption{Comparison of six methods for 23 event types respectively. Individual worker's performance is also included as comparison. Results of $\text{MAP}@t\%5$ are shown.}
\label{bar_result_event_type}
\end{figure*}

In the main paper, we mentioned that we used grid search on 5-fold cross validation to decide the parameters $\{\alpha, \beta, \lambda\}$ to incorporate the face heatmap. Among 23 event types, only 10 event types showed a performance gain after face information was incorporated in the validation set, and therefore face information was only used for these 10 event types. Table~\ref{face_table} shows the effect of incorporating face information for these 10 event types.

In Table~\ref{aesthetic_table}, we show the comparison of the results from single network with Euclidean loss (Euclidean), our method using Ensemble of siamese CNNs (Ensemble-CNN), and our method  after incorporating face information (Ensemble-CNN + face). This is in addition to the result table we presented in the main paper.  As mentioned in the main paper, with face information, $\text{MAP}$ is slightly improved by about 0.1\%, and the face heatmap network helped very little.

\subsection{Qualitative Results}
In addition to the visual example of our method's performance in the main paper, we show more examples of our method. Here we present 64 examples from all 23 event types from Figure~\ref{fig11} to Figure~\ref{fig74}. For each album, we show top 10-20\% images of the album from three methods. For each method, the top photos returned are arranged in chronological	order.
(Each album has different size, while we want to constrain the number of images we show to make it easier to view.) First row is the ground truth we acquired from AMT worker; second row is our prediction using Ensemble-CNN which we introduced in the main paper; third row is the result from random selection. Note that the images are distorted for viewing.

 We can see that for most albums that have strong narrative structure or albums that consist of images that vary much in quality or semantics, our method's results are close to, though do not perfectly match the ground truth result; on the contrary, the results from random selection are obviously less appealing (for example,  Figure~\ref{fig11}, \ref{fig14}, \ref{fig36}, etc.).  For instance, in Figure~\ref{fig23}, our method captures the important moments of the wedding event, similar to those people picked (in the ground truth); however random selection has many images that are less important, for example, photos of people eating, or photos of guests talking, while not looking at the camera.
 
 There are also some albums in which most of the images are of similar quality or semantics, for example, Figure~\ref{fig17}, \ref{fig49}.
