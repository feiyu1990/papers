	Abstract = {<p>This paper presents our contribution to the ChaLearn Challenge 2015 on Cultural Event Classification. The challenge in this task is to automatically classify images from 50 different cultural events. Our solution is based on the combination of visual features extracted from convolutional neural networks with temporal information using a hierarchical classifier scheme. We extract visual features from the last three fully connected layers of both CaffeNet (pretrained with ImageNet) and our fine tuned version for the ChaLearn challenge. We propose a late fusion strategy that trains a separate low-level SVM on each of the extracted neural codes. The class predictions of the low-level SVMs form the input to a higher level SVM, which gives the final event scores. We achieve our best result by adding a temporal refinement step into our classification scheme, which is applied directly to the output of each low-level SVM. Our approach penalizes high classification scores based on visual features when their time stamp does not match well an event-specific temporal distribution learned from the training and validation data. Our system achieved the second best result in the \&nbsp;ChaLearn Challenge 2015 on Cultural Event Classification with a mean average precision of 0.767 on the test set.</p><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06567">[Preprint in arXiv]</a>\&nbsp;<a href="http://gesture.chalearn.org/mmworkshop">[Workshop site]</a>\&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KCYNFeV-UtGjZ8WgT9vhZAC2etr7XfPVwDV_oX4WbMg/pub?start=false\&amp;loop=false\&amp;delayms=3000">[Slides on GDrive]</a></p><p>\&nbsp;</p><center><iframe style="border: 1px solid $\#$CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100\%;" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/1gtcANxCv2nkty" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="425" height="355"></iframe><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/xavigiro/cultural-event-recognition-with-visual-convnets-and-temporal-models" target="_blank" title="Cultural Event Recognition with Visual ConvNets and Temporal Models">Cultural Event Recognition with Visual ConvNets and Temporal Models</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/xavigiro" target="_blank">Xavier Giro</a></strong></div></center>},

   abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}
